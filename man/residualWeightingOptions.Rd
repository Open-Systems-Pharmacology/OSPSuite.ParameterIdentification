\description{
Methods for weighting residuals in the model cost function, affecting how
discrepancies between simulations and observed data are evaluated.
}
\details{
The methods include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{none}} – No weighting applied, treating all residuals equally.
\item \strong{\code{error}} – Weights based on error estimates for the dependent variable
in observed data.
\item \strong{\code{std}} – Weights equal to the reciprocal of the standard deviation of
the observed data.
\item \strong{\code{mean}} – Weights based on the reciprocal of the mean of the absolute
values of the observed data, useful for relative error scaling.
