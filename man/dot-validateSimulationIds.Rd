\title{Validates Matching IDs across Simulation IDs, PI Parameters, and Output Mappings}
\usage{
.validateSimulationIds(simulationIds, piParameters, outputMappings)
}
\arguments{
\item{simulationIds}{Vector of simulation IDs.}

\item{piParameters}{List of \code{PIParameter} instances, from which IDs are extracted
and validated against simulationIds.}

\item{outputMappings}{List of \code{OutputMapping} instances, from which IDs are
extracted and validated against simulationIds.}
}
\value{
TRUE if all IDs match accordingly, otherwise throws an error detailing
the mismatch or absence of IDs.
}
\description{
Ensures that every Simulation ID is present and matches with corresponding IDs
in PIParameter and OutputMapping instances. This function is crucial for
maintaining consistency and preventing mismatches that could disrupt parameter
identification processes.
