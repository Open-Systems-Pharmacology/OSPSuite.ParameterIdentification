## Introduction

The `ospsuite.parameteridentification` package provides tools to estimate model
parameters by fitting simulations to observed data. After the optimization step,
confidence intervals (CIs) can be used to assess the uncertainty of the estimated
parameters and to evaluate how robust the results are.

This vignette describes the available methods for confidence interval estimation,
explains how to configure and run them, and shows how to inspect the results.

## Choosing a CI Method

-   **`hessian`** is the default method. It estimates confidence intervals from the
    curvature of the objective function at the optimum. This approach is fast and
    works well when the problem is well-behaved and the objective function is
    approximately quadratic.

-   **`PL`** (profile likelihood) computes confidence intervals by scanning the
    likelihood along each parameter. It is more robust for parameters near bounds or
    in situations where the likelihood is not well approximated by a quadratic shape,
    but it is slower.

-   **`bootstrap`** generates confidence intervals by repeatedly resampling the
    observed data and re-fitting the model. This method is robust and makes
    only minimal assumptions about the likelihood, but it is computationally
    more intensive than the other methods.

    Resampling depends on the type of observed data:

    -   For individual datasets, new samples of individuals are drawn.  
    -   For aggregated datasets, resampling is based on Gaussian Process
        Regression (GPR).  
    -   With both types of data, a mixed strategy is applied.  
    -   User-defined dataset weights are respected during resampling.


## Advanced Configuration Options

Each confidence interval method provides a predefined set of default options. 
These defaults are available through the helper objects `CIOptions_Hessian`,
`CIOptions_PL`, and `CIOptions_Bootstrap`.  
The corresponding object is assigned to `piConfiguration$ciOptions` and individual fields can then be modified as required.  

### Explanation of options

Common options:  
- `epsilon`: numerical step size used in approximations  
- `confLevel`: confidence level (e.g. `0.95` for 95% confidence intervals)  

Additional options for profile likelihood (PL):  
- `maxIter`: maximum number of iterations  

Additional options for bootstrap:  
- `nBootstrap`: number of bootstrap resamples  
- `seed`: random seed for reproducibility  

If no method is specified, the default is the **`hessian`** method with its standard options.  

### Minimal configuration example

Configuration of confidence intervals is done through the `PIConfiguration` object, which also holds all other settings for parameter identification.  
The example below shows how the Hessian method is selected and its default options adjusted:


```{r}
piConfiguration <- PIConfiguration$new()

# select CI method
piConfiguration$ciMethod  <- "hessian"

# assign default options and adjust if necessary
piConfiguration$ciOptions <- CIOptions_Hessian
piConfiguration$ciOptions$confLevel <- 0.95
```


By default, confidence intervals are estimated immediately after each optimization 
run (`autoEstimateCI = TRUE`). To disable this behaviour and perform CI estimation later, set the flag to `FALSE`:

```{r}
piConfiguration$autoEstimateCI <- FALSE
```

In this case, the optimization is executed first and CI estimation is triggered
explicitly when needed, for example to review results before running the more
time-consuming CI calculation.

```{r}
piResult <- piTask$run()
piResult <- piTask$estimateCI()
```



## Reading CI results

The printout of a `PIResult` object shows the main outcomes of a parameter identification run, including parameter estimates, standard deviations, coefficients of variation, and confidence intervals (if available).

For programmatic access, the results of a PI run can be exported either as a 
data frame or as a list:

```{r}
df  <- piResult$toDataFrame()   # tidy table with estimates, sd, cv, lowerCI, upperCI, etc.
lst <- piResult$toList()        # full details including cost information and CI-specific details
```

The list output also contains a `ciDetails` entry where method-specific 
information is stored:

- `hessian`: Hessian matrix, covariance matrix, eigenvalues, and correlation matrix  
- `PL`: parameter history and likelihood thresholds  
- `bootstrap`: bootstrap replicates, empirical confidence bounds, and the seed 
used for resampling  


## Practical tips

- Start with the `hessian` method as it is the default and runs quickly. If 
confidence intervals appear implausible (too wide, asymmetric, or `NA`), repeat 
the analysis with `bootstrap`.  

- When CI calculation fails, check parameter bounds, scaling (`lin` or `log`), 
and residual weighting. Poorly chosen settings in these areas often prevent 
reliable CI estimation.  

- For `bootstrap`, begin with a small number of resamples (for example 100â€“200) 
to test the setup, then increase as needed. Always set a `seed` if reproducible 
results are required.
