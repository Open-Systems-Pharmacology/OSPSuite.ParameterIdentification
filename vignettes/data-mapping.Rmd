## Introduction

## Introduction

This vignette shows how to link simulation outputs to observed data and how to
apply weights and transformations in the parameter identification workflow.  
Mappings are created with the `PIOutputMapping` class, which connects a simulation
quantity to one or more observed datasets. Each mapping can be customized by
assigning dataset- or point-specific weights and by applying transformations such
as offsets or scaling factors. These adjustments help align observed and simulated
values and control how much influence each dataset has on the optimization.


## Creating a mapping

Mappings are created with the `PIOutputMapping` class, which connects a simulation
quantity (for example a plasma concentration) to one or more observed datasets.  
The quantity itself is retrieved from a loaded simulation via `getQuantity`.

In the following we use the Aciclovir example simulation:

```{r create-mapping}
library(ospsuite.parameteridentification)

# Load example simulation
simulation <- loadSimulation(
  system.file("extdata", "Aciclovir.pkml", package = "ospsuite")
)

# Retrieve a quantity by path from the simulation
quantity <- getQuantity(
  path = "Organism|PeripheralVenousBlood|Aciclovir|Plasma (Peripheral Venous Blood)",
  container = simulation
)

# Create a new mapping for this quantity
outputMapping <- PIOutputMapping$new(quantity = quantity)
```

The `path` corresponds to the quantity’s location in the simulation structure.
At this point, `outputMapping` represents the link between the chosen simulation output
and the observed data that will be added next.

For a full description of all fields and methods, see the [`PIOutputMapping`](https://www.open-systems-pharmacology.org/OSPSuite.ParameterIdentification/reference/PIOutputMapping.html) documentation.


## Adding observed data

Observed datasets can be imported from Excel and attached to the mapping.  
Import settings (such as the naming pattern) are defined via an importer 
configuration. For more background on working with observed data and importing 
from Excel, see the [Observed data](https://www.open-systems-pharmacology.org/OSPSuite-R/articles/observed-data.html)
article in the {ospsuite} documentation.

```{r add-data}
filePath <- system.file("extdata", "Aciclovir_Profiles.xlsx",
                        package = "ospsuite.parameteridentification")

importConfig <- createImporterConfigurationForFile(filePath)
importConfig$namingPattern <- "{Source}.{Sheet}.{Dose}"

obsData <- loadDataSetsFromExcel(
  xlsFilePath = filePath,
  importerConfigurationOrPath = importConfig,
  importAllSheets = TRUE
)

# Attach one or more datasets to the mapping (labels come from the naming pattern)
outputMapping$addObservedDataSets(
  data = obsData$`Aciclovir_Profiles.Vergin 1995.Iv.250 mg`
)
```


## Scaling

Scaling specifies whether residuals are calculated on the raw (linear) scale or 
on a logarithmic scale. The default is linear (`"lin"`), but logarithmic scaling (`"log"`)
can be selected to emphasize relative differences when data span several orders of
magnitude.

```{r set-scaling}
outputMapping$scaling <- "log"
```


## Setting weights

Weights control the relative influence of observed data on the optimization.  
They can be supplied directly when datasets are added to a mapping, or they can be
set or updated later with `setDataWeights()`. In both cases, weights are passed as
a named list where the names must match the dataset labels.


### Adding weights directly

Weights can be attached at the time of adding datasets. This allows entire datasets
to be up- or down-weighted in one step.


```{r example-1, eval=FALSE}
## Not run: example only
exampleMapping$addObservedDataSets(
  data = list("Study A" = dsA, "Study B" = dsB),
  weights = list(
    "Study A" = 1.0,   
    "Study B" = 0.5    
  )
)
## End(Not run)
```

The code above is illustrative and not executed here.


### Example with one dataset

In the Aciclovir example only one dataset is mapped. A vector of weights is used,
with one weight per data point:

```{r set-weights}
# number of observed points
nPoints <- length(obsData$`Aciclovir_Profiles.Vergin 1995.Iv.250 mg`$yValues)

# give less weight to the first 3 points, full weight to the rest
outputMapping$setDataWeights(
  list(
    "Aciclovir_Profiles.Vergin 1995.Iv.250 mg" =
      c(rep(0.3, 3), rep(1.0, nPoints - 3))
  )
)
```

Printing the `PIOutputMapping` object provides a concise summary showing the 
output path and the labels of attached datasets, the labels where weights were 
applied, and the selected scaling:

```{r print-mapping}
print(outputMapping)
```

The assigned weights can also be accessed directly via the dataWeights field,
which is useful for validation:

```{r print-weights}
outputMapping$dataWeights
```


### Other options

Weights are always applied at the level of individual data points. Using a 
single scalar for a dataset (for example `0.5`) is just a shorthand, which 
internally assigns that same weight to every point in the dataset.  

The examples below illustrate the different ways weights can be specified.


#### Dataset-level weights 

A scalar weight is broadcast to all points of a dataset:

```{r example-2, eval=FALSE}
## Not run: example only
outputMapping$setDataWeights(
  list(
    "StudyA" = 1.0,  # full influence
    "StudyB" = 0.5   # down-weight entire dataset
  )
)
## End(Not run)
```


#### Point-level weights

A numeric vector with the same length as the dataset’s y-values:

```{r example-3, eval=FALSE}
## Not run: example only
outputMapping$setDataWeights(list(
  "StudyB" = c(0.25, 0.25, 0.25, rep(1.0, 7))  # lower weight on first 3 points
))
```


#### Combined effects

Dataset- and point-level effects can be combined by multiplying them before
passing to `setDataWeights()`:

```{r example-4, eval=FALSE}
## Not run: example only
baseWeight <- 0.6
pointWeights <- ifelse(seq_along(dataSetB$yValues) <= 3, 0.3, 1.0)

outputMapping$setDataWeights(list(
  "StudyB" = baseWeight * pointWeights
))
## End(Not run)
```


## Transformations

Observed data can be adjusted through transformations to improve comparability
with the corresponding simulation output. This is done per dataset or globally
for all datasets in the mapping. Transformations allow offsets and scaling
factors to be applied to x- and y-values, for example to account for systematic
shifts between experiments or to align starting points across datasets.

```{r set-transformations}
outputMapping$setDataTransformations(
  labels   = "Aciclovir_Profiles.Vergin 1995.Iv.250 mg",
  xOffsets = 0.5, yOffsets = 0,
  xFactors = 1,   yFactors = 1
)

outputMapping$dataTransformations
```


## Practical tips

- Use scalar dataset weights for coarse emphasis or down-weighting of assays.
- Use point-level vectors to emphasize a time window or de-emphasize outliers.
- Prefer `log` scaling when values span orders of magnitude.
- If weighting errors occur, first check label names and vector lengths.
