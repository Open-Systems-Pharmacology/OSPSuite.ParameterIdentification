Short intro

## Used algorithms

Describe BRIEFLY the different algorithms that are used in the PI package.
If implemented in a third-party package, refer to the documentation of that package.

If feasible, list algorithm options.

Give rough guidlines which algorithm to use in which situation.


Default algorithm is the BOBYQA method (bound optimization by quadratic approximation), a local derivative-based method. For complex problems where the objective function may lack stable numerical derivatives or may have a large number of local minima, HJKB for derivative-free Hooke-Jeeves algorithm or DEoptim for global stochastic differential evolution algorithm may provide better results at the cost of overall execution time.
