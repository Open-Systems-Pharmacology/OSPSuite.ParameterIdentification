The **ospsuite.parameteridentification** R package provides the
functionality of performing parameter identification (i.e., fitting the
model to observed data) with simulations created in the Open Systems
Pharmacology Software tools PK-Sim and MoBi. The package requires the
[**ospsuite**](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R)
package to run the simulations.

## Installation

### Windows

The package can be installed from GitHub using the `{remotes}` package.
Under Windows, simply run the following code:

``` r
# {ospsuite.parameteridentification} and its Open Systems Pharmacology Suite's dependencies relies on
# {rClr} (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/rClr) which is not
# available on CRAN.
# Therefore, these must be installed from github using `{remotes}`.
# You can skip this step if you have already installed the `{ospsuite`} package.

install.packages("remotes")
install.packages("https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/rClr/releases/download/v0.9.2/rClr_0.9.2.zip",
  type = "binary"
)

remotes::install_github("Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite.ParameterIdentification@*release")
```

Get the latest development version with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite.ParameterIdentification")
```

### Linux

For Linux, follow the instructions to install
[{`ospsuite`}](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite-R?tab=readme-ov-file#on-linux)
first and then run

``` r
remotes::install_github("Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSPSuite.ParameterIdentification@*release")
```

(remove `@*release` to get the latest development version).

## User guide

Examples of running parameter estimation tasks using this package are
detailed in `vignette('user-guide')`.
